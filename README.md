# Solar system simulation
Multibody motion simulation

  Simple simulation system for our solar system in 2D. You can add any number of planet into the simulation at will. 
  The simulation is based on NewTon's law and Rungeâ€“Kutta methods. As using high precison algorithm, the results can be treated as real physics. Improvements are on the way.
  
  
  All done by C++ in Qt 5.13.0
