# solar-system-simulation-ver2.1

Multibody motion simulation

Simple simulation system for our solar system in 2D. You can add any number of planet into the simulation at will. The simulation is based on NewTon's law and Rungeâ€“Kutta methods. As using high precison algorithm, the results can be treated as real physics. Improvements are on the way.

Changes in ver2.0: add dynamic velocity charts.

Changes in ver2.1: fix bugs.

All done by C++ in Qt 5.7.0
